# Further customization

## Labels

Usually we try to avoid spaces when using names for the column names, but for our plots this could be not the most straight forward way to communicate our analysis, we can set specific labels to make our plots more readable and self explanatory. Let's improve bar plot figure a bit more to make it clearer:

```{r}
figures$bars <- captures %>% 
  count(year, wt = treated) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = year, y = n), stat = 'identity') + # type of barplot
  labs(# We will use the function labs to generate our labels
    title = 'Number of treated by year',
    x = 'Year',
    y = 'Number of treated'
  )

figures$bars
```

## Themes

ggplot includes the function `theme()` to define most of the aspects of the figure such as the background color, the grid, axes, legend, among many others. There is also several predefined themes (all start with `theme_` followed by the name of the theme) that you can use, if don't want to mess with all the arguments from the function `theme()`. For example:

```{r}
# all the predefined themes start with theme_
figures$timeseries <- tCaptures %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = week, y = n)) +
  labs(title = 'Treated by week', x = 'Week', y = 'Number of treated') +
  theme_minimal() # We will use the theme minimal

figures$timeseries
```

## Other aesthetics

### Shape

There are other aesthetics we can define such as color, type of point, size, among many others. Lets try changing the point shape for one of the plots we previously did:

```{r}
figures$scatter <- captures %>% # the data we are using
  ggplot() + # we set the canvas
  geom_point(aes(
    x = captures, # X axis
    y = treated, # Y axis
    shape = factor(trap_type) # point shape
  )) +
  labs(title = 'Captures and treatments by year', x = 'Captures', y = 'Treated', shape = 'Trap type') +
  theme_classic() # now lets try the theme 'classic'

figures$scatter
```

### Color

In the next example we will use the trap type to color our boxplot:

```{r fill}
captures %>% 
  ggplot() + # set the canvas
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = treated, fill = factor(trap_type))) # we add a boxplot layer
```

We can also use the variable to color other parts of the plot such as the border:

```{r col}
captures %>% 
  ggplot() + # set the canvas
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = treated, col = factor(trap_type))) # we add a boxplot layer
```

### Non aesthetics customization

So far we have added variables inside our `aes()` function, but we can add some arguments outside the `aes()` function that we want them to be applied for all observations. For example, we can change the outline of the boxplot to be the same for the two groups, but the fill color different per group:

```{r}
captures %>% 
  ggplot() + # set the canvas
  geom_boxplot(
    aes(y = treated, fill = factor(trap_type)), # This is the normal aesthetics we define
    col = 'red' # all aesthetics we define here will be applied to all th ebservations
  ) # we add a boxplot layer
```

## Colors

To define specific colors for our figure, we can use the function `scale_*_manual` where the * represents the aesthetic we want to represent. If we want to use the color for the fill, we would use:

```{r colors}
figures$box <- captures %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = treated, fill = factor(trap_type))) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('salmon', 'lightgreen', 'skyblue', 'orchid')) +
  labs(fill = 'trap type') +
  # theme_linedraw() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_line(colour = 'grey98'), 
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(), 
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'grey94'), 
        axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank())

figures$box
```


R manages colors in three different ways: by name (i.e: 'red'), by rgb value using the function `rgb()` (i.e. `rgb(1, 0, 0)`), or using [hexadecimal code](https://marketing.istockphoto.com/blog/hex-colors-guide/) (i.e. "#F00000"). You can get a full list of the named colors in R by using the function `colors()`, but you will only be able to see the names. Luckly someone made a tool that can help us exacly the colors that we want: the *Colour Picker* addin. Addins are tools that are available in Rstudio to facilitate tasks, lets try the colour picker (should be already in your addins toolbar).

**Exercise: ** Pick 4 colors you like and use them to create a boxplot of the distribution of number of treated by the trap type.

```{r include = F}
captures %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = treated, fill = factor(trap_type))) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('red4', 'blue3', 'skyblue', 'orchid'))
```


```{r Export objects, include=F}
# For now do it mannualy
save(captures, file = 'misc/II/captures.RData')
save(figures, file = 'misc/II/figures.RData')
save(tCaptures, file = 'misc/II/tCaptures.RData')
```
